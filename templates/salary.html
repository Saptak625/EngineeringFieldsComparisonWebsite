    <hr>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Aerospace engineering salaries depend upon many factors including experience, industry segment, job location, and educational credentials. Senior-level aerospace engineers obviously command higher salaries than their junior-level counterparts. Additionally, aerospace engineers that work on defense systems that require security clearances often have higher salaries than those simply working on commercial aircraft upgrades. <br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;These engineers working in the defense industry also experience a greater amount of job security while their colleagues who work on commercial aircraft worry about manufacturing jobs being sent overseas.</p>

    <h3 class="mt-5">Civil Engineering Salary Detail</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;The bottom ten percent make about $50,650 yearly and the top ten percent earns more than 119,000 dollars. All of which is above the national median of 36.3 thousand.
The employment outlook for Civil engineers is also good. As the population grows and the need to expand structures increases, more civil engineers are needed. Aging infrastructure is another driver in the need for more civil engineers. The Board of Labor Statistics predicts the demand for CEs will rise as much as 19 percent over the next ten years.
